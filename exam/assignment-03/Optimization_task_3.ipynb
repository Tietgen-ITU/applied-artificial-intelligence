    "## Portfolio Optimization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simplified example of a portfolio optimization problem. If you are interested in how portfolio optimization works in detail check out these resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-data-science-in-the-portfolio-management-process-56d559a3d39\n",
    "\n",
    "https://towardsdatascience.com/the-science-of-portfolio-optimization-186607d30416\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we will imagine that we have collected all the necessary information to optimize asset allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are an investor with a budget. You want to invest this budget in a portfolio consisting of $N$ different assets (stocks or any other asset that is expected to gain in value over time). Each asset has an expected return and a risk associated with it. Your objective is to maximize the expected return while keeping the portfolio risk below a certain threshold. Additionally, you want to ensure that no single asset takes up more than 40% of the total investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this problem challenging is that asset risks are correlated, i.e. investing in two assets might mean that their returns follow each other. For example: stocks of two cryptocurrency companies will crash together if the whole market crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have 5 assets to invest in.\n",
    "Asset 1:\n",
    " - Expected Return: 12%\n",
    " - Risk (Standard Deviation): 15%\n",
    "\n",
    "Asset 2:\n",
    " - Expected Return: 8%\n",
    " - Risk (Standard Deviation): 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "Asset 3:\n",
    " - Expected Return: 10%\n",
    " - Risk (Standard Deviation): 12%\n",
    "\n",
    "Asset 4:\n",
    " - Expected Return: 6%\n",
    " - Risk (Standard Deviation): 8%\n",
    "\n",
    "Asset 5:\n",
    " - Expected Return: 14%\n",
    " - Risk (Standard Deviation): 20%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " We also have a risk covariance matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    " ```python\n",
    "covariance_matrix = np.array([\n",
    "    [0.0225, 0.003, 0.0025, 0.0015, 0.004],\n",
    "    [0.003, 0.01, 0.002, 0.001, 0.003],\n",
    "    [0.0025, 0.002, 0.0144, 0.0012, 0.0028],\n",
    "    [0.0015, 0.001, 0.0012, 0.0064, 0.0015],\n",
    "    [0.004, 0.003, 0.0028, 0.0015, 0.04]\n",
    "])\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "The objective is to find a vector of allocation values $w$ (how much of the budget should go to each asset) to maximize the expected return of the entire investment portfolio, while respecting risk constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "$w$: Vector of weights representing the proportion of the total budget allocated to each asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "$r$: Vector of expected returns for each asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Σ$: Covariance matrix of the asset returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "$λ$: Risk-aversion parameter, where higher values indicate greater aversion to risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected return of the portfolio is:\n",
    "$E(R_p)=\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{r}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance (risk) of the portfolio is:\n",
    "$σ_p^2=\\mathbf{w}^TΣ\\mathbf{w}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The fitness function $F(w)$ that combines return and risk can be defined as:\n",
    "$F(w)=E(R_p)-λ⋅σ_p^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "or, equivalently:\n",
    "$F(w)=\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{r}-λ⋅\\mathbf{w}^TΣ\\mathbf{w}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights must sum to 1 (i.e., the total budget must be fully allocated):\n",
    "$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i=1$\n",
    "\n",
    "No single asset should account for more than 40% of the total budget:\n",
    "$w_i≤0.4$ for all $i$\n",
    "\n",
    "The portfolio risk (standard deviation) should be below a certain threshold (if applicable):\n",
    "$\\mathbf{w}^TΣ\\mathbf{w}≤threshold$"
