You want to invest this budget in a portfolio consisting of $N$ different assets (stocks or any other asset that is expected to gain in value over time). Each asset has an expected return and a risk associated with it. Your objective is to maximize the expected return while keeping the portfolio risk below a certain threshold. Additionally, you want to ensure that no single asset takes up more than 40% of the total investment.\n","\n","What makes this problem challenging is that asset risks are correlated, i.e. investing in two assets might mean that their returns follow each other. For example: stocks of two cryptocurrency companies will crash together if the whole market crashes.\n","\n","**Task:**\n","\n","Imagine we have 5 assets to invest in.\n","Asset 1:\n"," - Expected Return: 12%\n"," - Risk (Standard Deviation): 15%\n","\n","Asset 2:\n"," - Expected Return: 8%\n"," - Risk (Standard Deviation): 10%\n","\n","Asset 3:\n"," - Expected Return: 10%\n"," - Risk (Standard Deviation): 12%\n","\n","Asset 4:\n"," - Expected Return: 6%\n"," - Risk (Standard Deviation): 8%\n","\n","Asset 5:\n"," - Expected Return: 14%\n"," - Risk (Standard Deviation): 20%\n","\n","\n"," We also have a risk covariance matrix:\n","\n"," ```python\n","covariance_matrix = np.array([\n","    [0.0225, 0.003, 0.0025, 0.0015, 0.004],\n","    [0.003, 0.01, 0.002, 0.001, 0.003],\n","    [0.0025, 0.002, 0.0144, 0.0012, 0.0028],\n","    [0.0015, 0.001, 0.0012, 0.0064, 0.0015],\n","    [0.004, 0.003, 0.0028, 0.0015, 0.04]\n","])\n"," ```\n","\n","**Objective:**\n","The objective is to find a vector of allocation values $w$ (how much of the budget should go to each asset) to maximize the expected return of the entire investment portfolio, while respecting risk constraints.\n","\n","Parameters\n","\n","$w$: Vector of weights representing the proportion of the total budget allocated to each asset.\n","\n","$r$: Vector of expected returns for each asset.\n","\n","$Σ$: Covariance matrix of the asset returns.\n","\n","$λ$: Risk-aversion parameter, where higher values indicate greater aversion to risk.\n","\n","The expected return of the portfolio is:\n","$E(R_p)=\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{r}$\n","\n","The variance (risk) of the portfolio is:\n","$σ_p^2=\\mathbf{w}^TΣ\\mathbf{w}$\n","\n","The fitness function $F(w)$ that combines return and risk can be defined as:\n","$F(w)=E(R_p)-λ⋅σ_p^2$\n","\n","or, equivalently:\n","$F(w)=\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{r}-λ⋅\\mathbf{w}^TΣ\\mathbf{w}$\n","\n","\n","**Constraints:**\n","\n","The weights must sum to 1 (i.e., the total budget must be fully allocated):\n","$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i=1$\n","\n","No single asset should account for more than 40% of the total budget:\n","$w_i≤0.4$ for all $i$\n","\n","The portfolio risk (standard deviation) should be below a certain threshold (if applicable):\n","$\\mathbf{w}^TΣ\\mathbf{w}≤threshold$"],"metadata":{"id":"uUXu44-JgeNK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Fitness function evaluating porfolio return with constraints"],"metadata":{"id":"BqvGJySDsabS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","# Define the parameters\n","expected_returns = np.array([0.12, 0.08, 0.10, 0.06, 0.14])\n","covariance_matrix = np.array([\n","    [0.0225, 0.003, 0.0025, 0.0015, 0.004],\n","    [0.003, 0.01, 0.002, 0.001, 0.003],\n","    [0.0025, 0.002, 0.0144, 0.0012, 0.0028],\n","    [0.0015, 0.001, 0.0012, 0.0064, 0.0015],\n","    [0.004, 0.003, 0.0028, 0.0015, 0.04]\n","])\n","risk_aversion = 1.0  # Example risk-aversion parameter\n","max_risk_threshold = 0.12  # Example risk threshold\n","\n","\n","# Define the fitness function\n","def fitness(weights):\n","    # Normalize weights to sum to 1\n","    weights = weights / np.sum(weights)\n","\n","    # Calculate expected return\n","    portfolio_return = np.dot(weights, expected_returns)\n","\n","    # Calculate portfolio risk (variance)\n","    portfolio_variance = np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(covariance_matrix, weights))\n","\n","    # Calculate fitness\n","    fitness_value = portfolio_return - risk_aversion * portfolio_variance\n","\n","    if portfolio_variance > max_risk_threshold or np.any(weights > 0.4):\n","        fitness_value = -np.inf\n","\n","    return fitness_value\n","\n","# Example weights (randomly chosen, should be optimized)\n","weights = np.array([0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2])\n","\n","# Calculate the fitness value\n","fitness_value = fitness(weights)\n","print(\"Fitness Value:\", fitness_value)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hDih4vkzsluo","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722585026669,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Đorđe Grbić","userId":"17224412897437983949"}},"outputId":"8ec0cec7-4ee0-4c91-9c53-0af3f688a0d1"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Fitness Value: 0.09446800000000001\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The solution should look like:\n","\n","```\n","Total return: some_value\n","Allocation: [permutation of job indices]\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"lshqzbXeuHbZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Implement the algorithm\n","make sure to comment on the code.
