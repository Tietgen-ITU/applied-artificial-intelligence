    "The PlantVillage dataset contains 54,304 images. The images span 14 crop species: Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Bell Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, Tomato. In containes images of 17 fungal diseases, 4 bacterial diseases, 2 mold (oomycete) diseases, 2 viral disease, and 1 disease caused by a mite. 12 crop species also have images of healthy leaves that are not visibly affected by a disease.\n",

    "For this assignment, you will make a model that predicts whether an potato leaf comes from a healthy or unhealthy plant (binary classification). The healthy apple leaf images are in the `Potato___healthy` folder, while unhealthy apple leaf images are in `Potato___Early_blight` and `Potato___Late_blight`. You are allowed to use a pretrained model that you transfer to this problem, if you whish so. Keep in mind that the dataset is highly unbalanced (152 vs 1000 vs 1000) so make sure to augment the dataset to account for that."
